## Develop with Netlify Create Locally

The typical development process is to begin by working locally. Clone this repository, then run `npm install` in its root directory.

Run the Next.js development server:

```txt
cd content-ops-demo
npm run dev
```

Install the [Netlify Create CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stackbit/cli). Then open a new terminal window in the same project directory and run the Netlify Create Dev server:

```txt
npm install -g @stackbit/cli
stackbit dev
```

This outputs your own Netlify Create URL. Open this, register or sign in, and you will be directed to Netlify Create's visual editor for your new project.
